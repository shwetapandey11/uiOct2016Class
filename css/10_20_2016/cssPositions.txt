in css, we have certain styles to break off from the document flow (parent-child flow).

1. float - it breaks off from the document flow and puts the element either left or in right. it does not support vertical break offs

float: left
float: right
float: none


2. position - it too breaks off from the main document flow but, it maintains its own document flow:
there are several options for position:

	i. relative - this is equivalent to saying that no position is needed
	ii. fixed - this fixes the element at that position regardless of document flow
	iii. absolute - this breaks off from the document flow and can be placed both vertically and horizontally using:

	a. top
	b. bottom

	c. left
	d. right
