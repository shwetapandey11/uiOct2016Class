so far we have been using the math unit as 'px'



px -> its the smallest unit of the screen. our screen/monitor resolution defines the pixels.
(1920x1080) (4000x2000)


em -> its the unit with respective to the font-size of the same element
example:
lets say i have one div with font-size as 12px. Now, if the width = 2em. This means, the width is 2 x 12 = 24px


ex -> we rarely use. we dont see them in action. These are calculated based on the the x-height of the element


ch -> we rarely use. we dont see them in action. These are with respective to "0" width


rem -> we rarely use. BUT we DO see them in action sometimes. These are calculated based on the font-size of the root element.
example:
if <html> has a style of font-size: 14px and a div has 2rem width then the width is 14 * 2 = 28px.


vw -> this is viewport width. And its calculated as 1% of the viewport width.
example:
lets say we have div with width of 20vm. This means 20% of the width of the screen.


vh -> this is viewport height. And its calculated as 1% of the viewport height.
example:
lets say we have a div with height of 20vh. This means 20% of the height of the screen.

*****vw AND vh ARE MOSTLY USED FOR FONT-SIZES. NOT FOR WIDTH OR HEIGHT
 

vmin -> if we resize the browser or the screen, whichever dimension, wether width or height, has the lowest (or min value), it will take that
example:
lets say we have div of width 20vmin this means that when we resize the screen, and found out that the dimensions are 320(width)x200(height). Since, the height has the min value, the with of the div is 20% of 200 = 40px



vmax -> if we resize the browser or the screen, whichever dimension, wether width or height, has the highest (or max value), it will take that
example:
lets say we have div of width 20vmax this means that when we resize the screen, and found out that the dimensions are 320(width)x200(height). Since, the width has the max value, the with of the div is 20% of 320 = 64px


*****vmax AND vmin ARE MOSTLY USED FOR FONT-SIZES. NOT FOR WIDTH OR HEIGHT




% -> these take the screen dimensions as there mode of calculation.
example:
lets say i have a div of width 20%. this means that the width is 20% of the screen width. Meaning, if the screen resolution is 1920(width) x 1080(height) then the width of that div is 20% of 1920 = 384px



*****% ARE MAINLY USED FOR WIDTH OR HEIGHT
