CSS preprocessors:

CSS preprocessors, give us the power to process our css before it gets rendered/applied. To use the preprocessors, we can perform the processing on the client-side (using javascript) or we can perform the same on the server-side (using RUBY)


there are three css preprocessors:
1. sass (this is server-side processor. This uses ruby to run)
2. less (this is client-side processor. This uses javascript. to run this we need NODEJS)
3. stylus (this is the least used processors)


sass --watch styles.scss styles.css
lessc styles.less styles.css



.scss .less


MODULAR APPLICATION:
This is the concept in which we create re-usable modules which can be used anywhere in the application and any number of times.
