1. take the latest code and inside 12_05_2015-closures folder, create a new folder with your name.
2. using the concepts of closures and classes, create a class called 'Mathematics' inside another class called 'total'
*** MAKE SURE THAT 'Mathematics' IS NOT A PROPERTY OF 'total'
3. mathematics should take two numbers as arguements.
4. mathematics should have following properties:
    sum: this should result out sum of the two arguements
    difference: this should result out difference of the two arguements
    multiplication: this should result out multiplication of the two arguements
    division: this should result out division of the two arguements
5. using closures, create four properties in 'total':
    addition,
    substract,
    product,
    dividend

    make sure that these properties take the outputs from the 'mathematics' class.
6. console.log the answers
