Javascript


like in any language, JS also needs variables and to do that we say "var".


"var <name of the variable> = <value of the variable>;"

example:
var x = 10;
(When we use the keyword "var", we are defining a new variable called "x").


x = 20;
(when we dont use the keyword "var", it means that "x" was previously defined somewhere).


**Avoid write like this: var x; because JS will not know how much memory needs to get assigned.
ALWAYS INITIALIZE YOUR VARIABLES!


Thumb rules:
1. always define your variables by using keyword "var".
2. always initialize your variable.
