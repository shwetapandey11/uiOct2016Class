Datatypes


JS supports many data types.
In total, there are seven data types that javascript (ECMAScript 5) supports.
Data types are divided into three categories:

1. Primitive DT (which are five)
2. Object
3. functions


Primitive Data types:
These are the basic data types that you find in ECMAScript 5:
a. Number (integers and float - decimal number)
b. String (collection characters or alphabets is String. In short you can say a statement)
c. Boolean (this takes true or false)
d. null (this means that the variable is defined but has no value)
e. undefined (this means that the variable is not defined at all)

Object:
These are special of data types where we can define our own set of datatypes.
Objects take primitive data types inside them.
example:

var x = {
    firstName: "Srikar Shastry"
};

Functions:
functions are unique feature introduced in JS. these take a value and then gives out a result.
example:

var x = function(value){
    value + 1;
    return value;
};
