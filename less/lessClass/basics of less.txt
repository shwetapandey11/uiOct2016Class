the idea behind the less compiler is to compile (= check for errors, syntax, etc.) before converting to css.

less performs math.
less writes fewer styles
less can import another file.
less can reuse the style







to compile the less file, syntax is:
lessc <source to less file>  >  <destination of css file>


example:
lessc /less/styles.less > /styles/styles.css
